The Epic Games Store Launches on Mobile
Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe All Coming to the Epic Games Store for iPhones and Android, and to AltStore
Today the Epic Games Store is available for download on iPhones in the European Union and on Android devices worldwide. The store is launching with Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe and the all-new Fall Guys for mobile, and we are working to enable all developers to launch their games and apps through the Epic Games Store in the future. We are also bringing our games to independent mobile stores including AltStore PAL today:\

Typed throws in Swift
Swift was promoted as a type-safe programming language on its very first day, and it is solid and safe in many aspects. The part of type safety that needed to be added was throwing functions. Swift 6.0 introduces typed throws, and we will learn all about them this week:\

JSON Parsing in Swift explained with code examples
JSON parsing in Swift is a common thing to do. Almost every app decodes JSON to show data in a visualized way. Parsing JSON is definitely one of the basics you should learn as an iOS developer.
Decoding JSON in Swift is quite easy and does not require any external dependencies. The basic APIs that come with Swift will be enough to do the job, so let’s dive in:\

Let’s build iOS 18’s navigation title card in SwiftUI
iOS 18 standardizes a design pattern that could be called “navigation title cards”, for lack of an established HIG term. In their simplest form, these cards appear at the top of a list of content and provide brief explanatory text:\

We all know about Swift for iOS, MacOS, watchOS development and even for backend development. But what about embedded? Here it is
Embedded Swift Tutorial - Getting Started (Everything you need to know)
Apple announced Embedded Swift development at WWDC 2024. This new development target allows you to start coding for non-Apple hardware using Swift:\

Navigation Patterns in SwiftUI
Navigation has often been a challenge in SwiftUI applications. Initially, SwiftUI introduced NavigationView, which was later replaced by NavigationStack in iOS 16.
NavigationStack enhanced navigation by enabling dynamic and programmatic routing, and it also offered ways to centralize routes for the entire application. In this article, I’ll explore common navigation patterns that can be employed when building SwiftUI applications:\

How to upload assets using the App Store Connect API
When you create a new version of your app in App Store Connect, you might also need to upload new assets like screenshots or previews for the App Store. You can do this manually on the App Store Connect website, but if you have a lot of localizations to support and your assets change often across versions, this can be a tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming process:\

Truncating Text In SwiftUI
Text is the most common kind of content that apps contain. We deal with all sorts of text length everyday, but when it comes to long text we often need to cut it off and display just a part of it. Along with that, users usually get an option to expand and view the long text, or collapse and keep it truncated.
In this post we are going to demonstrate two ways that will let you achieve truncation easily, and an additional approach where you can simulate (fake) truncation by fetching and presenting a substring of the original string. As a bonus chapter, I’ll also show you how to expand and collapse truncated text, mostly because truncation and text expansion go together as features into an app:\

App design: 5 benefits of using system components
Building custom elements and ignoring the sometimes boring system components during app design can be appealing. However, these boring elements have many benefits you might not be aware of.
If you’ve read many of my technical articles, you might be surprised to hear that I’ve actually done a bachelor’s degree in Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD), also known as Interactive Media, in Amsterdam. I’ve had to teach myself coding on the side, resulting in a great mix of design and coding knowledge. In today’s article, I’ll share a few reasons why system components should not be overlooked:\

Pickup in 3 minutes: Uber’s implementation of Live Activity on iOS
The 2022 WWDC keynote brought an unexpected surprise when Apple™ unveiled the new Live Activities feature, using Uber’s Rider app as a prominent example. This announcement generated excitement for the feature to come and set the stage for an exhilarating journey for our team.
What follows is the story of how we started designing for surfaces outside the app, the engineering problems we had to solve along the way, and ultimately how we measurably improved the experience of riders and drivers:\

Scrolling pickers in SwiftUI
Today we’ll be exploring the features that ScrollView carrying around since iOS 17 by building a value picker.

Displaying Data with Table (Part I)
One of the most traditional ways of displaying data is through a table. Think about having to create one in a document, working with a spreadsheet, or (for the experienced dev) a database. That’s why the Table component is a powerful tool in the SwiftUI framework. It doesn’t take much code to get data beautifully laid out in our app.
A little more here and there and we can quickly add on features and styles to enhance the UX. We’ll explore that in Part II:\

How often do you use lazy keyword in your code? Maybe you need to refresh your knowledge about it? Here is the article for you
Lazy var in Swift explained with code examples
A lazy var is a property whose initial value is not calculated until the first time it’s called. It’s part of a family of properties in which we have constant properties, computed properties, and mutable properties.
A lazy property might be lesser known to beginners in Swift but are actually super valuable once you know when and how to use them. There are a few important things to learn so you know when to use which type of property:\

List or LazyVStack: Choosing the Right Lazy Container in SwiftUI
In the world of SwiftUI, List and LazyVStack, as two core lazy containers, offer robust support for developers to display large amounts of data. However, their similar performance in certain scenarios often causes confusion among developers when making a choice. This article aims to analyze the characteristics and advantages of these two components to help you make a better decision:\

Using PreviewModifier to build a previewing environment
Xcode 16 and iOS 18 come with a feature that allows us to build elaborate preview environments using a new PreviewModifier protocol. This protocol allows us to define objects that can create a single context or environment that’s cached and used across your SwiftUI previews:\

Blend Modes in SwiftUI
Blend modes play a crucial role in digital design, enabling designers to easily create complex visual effects like overlays and textures. They're essential for tasks like photo manipulation, creating lighting effects, and adding depth to images.
Blend modes, as the name suggests, blends the colors of multiple layers of pixels using mathematical formulas to determine each pixel's influence on the final image. You can combine any number of layers, but at a minimum, you'll need 2 layers - a base layer and a blend layer to create a blend mode effect:\
